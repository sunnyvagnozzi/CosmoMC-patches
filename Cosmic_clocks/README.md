# Cosmic clocks

## Introduction

This repository contains a patch to CosmoMC to include the cosmic clocks (CC) likelihood. CC use the differential evolution of passive early-type galaxies to estimate H(z) at various redshifts up to z~2 in a model-independent way: H(z)=-1/(1+z)dz/dt.              For the original paper proposing the use of CC, see Jimenez & Loeb, [Constraining cosmological parameters based on relative galaxy ages](https://inspirehep.net/record/559474), [Astrophys.J. 573 (2002) 37-42](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/340549/meta) [arXiv: astro-ph/0106145](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0106145)
